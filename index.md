>Dearest Charis,
<br>
<br>
TLDR: I think you’re pretty swell.
<br>
<br>
So it’s your birthday, and that’s pretty great. I mean without it, you wouldn’t be around and that would be a damn shame. In all seriousness though I think you are one incredible human being. From the moment I walked into that classroom I knew I had to get to know you. I never imagined a year and a half later we would be where we are. It hasn’t been easy, but oh man has it been such an incredible ride so far. I am so incredibly and fiercely proud of you. Your strength and resilience inspire me daily. Your kindness and capacity for such deep and profound empathy pushes me to be a better person. I wake up every morning and am blown away by the way you make yourself known in this world. I think you are just the bee’s fucking knees. The fact that I’m the lucky shmuck that gets to be your forever person still leaves me utterly gobsmacked. Thank you for your light, your love and your life.

<br>
Happy birthday my dearest human,

>What a vibrant soul you are! You have a tenacity and fire that is exciting to be around. You also have such deep compassion and love. I always think of you and Oliver enjoying Taylor Swift or All About That Bass. You also are the BEST train track builder!

>Dearest Charis,
<br>
<br>
I’ve reluctantly come to accept that life has seasons, and people wonder in and out of each others lives at points along the way. I want to say how fondly I look back at the season where you were a part of our family every week, taking care of our little boy. You loved him well, and he loved you - and it always brought me joy to have you in our home. I look forward to new seasons in life where our paths may cross frequently again. In the mean time, I am thankful for you. Thankful for your spunk, honesty, and vulnerability. Thankful for your strength, your willingness to speak out against injustice, and speak up for those who can’t speak up for themselves. You are an awesome human, loved by God and loved by others.
<br>
<br>
So many Happy Birthday’s. -DW

>I like Richard Beck's advice.  "When the way ahead is uncertain, don't ask 'what is the right way' - that we can never know.  Rather ask 'what is the wise way' and seek to go there - even when there are no guarantees."  
<br>
All our best wishes for the way ahead. - VC

>I see this in you Charis.  You have such great compassion and give so much of yourself to others.  You not only desire but are determined to make the world a better place and the people in it better people.  I am so grateful to have you in my life.  Sometimes you need self-care as well.  So the following quote is very appropriate for you.  
<br>
We love you.  - GC

>Charis.
You literally have so many things going on that I could talk about it’s hard to nail down just a few. You’re smart, funny, sexy, loyal, interested in others, you’re a leader, sincere, and have a way of communicating that draws people in to be curious about what you’re saying. And fortunately, you always have something to say. I love it. You are a source of love and light. You have an intense capacity for life inside of you, and even when you are low, and feel like shit, you are able to lift others spirits. You are so bloody generous. You let your full cup of charisma, love, bright lights and dance moves spill out.  I always feel so blessed when I get to spend time with you; I feel welcomed by your generous spirit and the conversation we had this summer when I first arrived was absolutely precious. It’s been incredible getting to witness your love for Dani and see it grow more and more. I love you, and I hope I will always be part of your life.
